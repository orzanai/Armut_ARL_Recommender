# Armut ARL Recommender

Armut, which is Turkey's largest online service platform, brings together service providers and those who want to receive services.
It enables easy access to services such as cleaning, renovation, and transportation with just a few touches on a computer or smartphone.
By using the dataset that includes the users who received services and the categories of services they received, it is aimed to
create a product recommendation system using Association Rule Learning.


## Dataset

The dataset consists of the services that customers have received and their categories.
It includes the date and time information for each received service.
